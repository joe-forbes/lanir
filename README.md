lanirDeviceService
========

``lanirDeviceService`` is a NodeJS service that provides an API for [LIRC](http://lirc.org). It uses Alex Bain's [lirc_node](https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_node) to handle communication between LIRC and NodeJS. The earliest versions of ``lanirDeviceService`` were based on Alex Bain's [lirc_web](https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web) project.

## What is this?
The LanIR Device Service is part of a master's report project in the Software Engineering Master's program at the University of Texas. More information available at [https://thejsf.wordpress.com/].
